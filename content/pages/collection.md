## Northwest Manuscripts Collection

WCNA acknowledges that we exist upon the traditional homeland of the Cayuse, Umatilla, Walla Walla and Nez Perce Peoples. WCNA collects and solicits donations of manuscripts and records from individuals and organizations of significance to the history and present of the Walla Walla region and the inland Pacific Northwest. Strengths of our manuscript collections include:

-   Records of early settlers and missionaries to the region
-   Records of Walla Walla businesses
-   Records of Walla Walla educational, religious, or cultural institutions
-   Letters, diaries, and other personal papers of Walla Walla residents
-   Photographic collections relating to the history of the Walla Walla region

We seek additional records of Walla Walla organizations, associations, and clubs, particularly from underrepresented populations including, but not limited to, women’s organizations, immigrant populations, people of color, the Latinx community, labor unions and organizations, and LGBTQIA+ identified organizations.
